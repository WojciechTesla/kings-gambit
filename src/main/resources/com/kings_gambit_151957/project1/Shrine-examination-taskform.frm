At a gallop!\n\n[Several hours later, they reach the quaint mountain village.]\n\nHjalmar: Right, we\u0027re here.\nGeralt: Meaning? Gonna explain what we\u0027re doing or not?\nHjalmar: Remember the wild men I sparred with? The ones we call Vildkaarls?\nGeralt: You might\u0027ve mentioned them when I walked in...\nHjalmar: This is Fornhala. Their village. They were the ones who changed into\n         bears. Just like in the legends about berserkers. I saw it with my\n         own eyes -- might\u0027ve been alone in that. Everyone else was starin\u0027 at\n         young Lugos. He claimed he could down a barrel of beer in one go.\n         Almost did it, too.\n\u003c/pre\u003e\u003cpre\u003e  Geralt: So what now?\n  Hjalmar: Simple. We welcomed the Vildkaarls under our roof, gave them food,\n           drink... And they spilled our blood. So now they must pay. In blood.\u003c/pre\u003e\u003cpre\u003e   Geralt: Nice and simple. Kind of plan I like.\n   Hjalmar: And that\u0027s why I like you. Come on, Wolf. The skalds\u0027ll sing of\n            our vengeance on the bears.\u003c/pre\u003e\u003cpre\u003e   Geralt: Should at least take one alive, make him testify before--\n   Hjalmar: This ain\u0027t the Continent, witcher.

They\u0027ve no wives nor children.\n  Geralt: So how do they reproduce? By budding?\n  Hjalmar: No. Those wishin\u0027 to devote their lives to battle come here to join\n           them. In the summertime they hunt, go on raids. Come winter they\n           sleep in their caves...with the bears. Least that\u0027s what folk say.\n  Geralt: Got a feeling it\u0027s more than gossip.\u003c/pre\u003e\u003cpre\u003e  Geralt: Why not speak up right away? Back there, in front of everyone?\n  Hjalmar: Cause they\u0027d \u0027ave started talkin\u0027. Questionin\u0027, quarrelin\u0027. Words\n           won\u0027t wipe the shame from my clan.

From what you said, they don\u0027t sound like the type to lack\n        courage. Let\u0027s look around. Could be nearby.\n\n[There are places to investigate:]\n\n• Spiked gloves...black with dried blood.\n• No women\u0027s clothing, items... No toys.\n  Hjalmar: Vildkaarls don\u0027t have families.

Needs examining.\n\n[They go up, finding the body near a bunch of clothing piles.]\n\nGeralt: A Skellige custom I don\u0027t know about?\nHjalmar: If it is, it\u0027s new to me as well.\n\n• Clothing... From six men. Just one body, though.\n• Body covered in bruises... Knuckles chafed raw.\n  Hjalmar: Fought bare-fisted. To the death. Some kind of trial?\n  Geralt: Probably. Or a very bloody sport.
