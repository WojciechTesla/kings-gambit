Freya, our lady...\nGeralt: Mind if I interrupt?\nHjort: Already have. What is it?\nGeralt: Someone spiked one of the mead barrels. With blood and something else,\n        an herb or a mushroom. Cerys said--\nHjort: Give me the horn. I know the smell... A mushroom -- mardroeme.\u003c/pre\u003e\u003cpre\u003e  Geralt: Mardroeme. Never heard of it.\n  Hjort: You\u0027ve another name for it on the Continent. Psilocybe, I believe?\n  Geralt: All right. Peasants eat it to soothe pain.\n  Hjort: Udalryk tried it, too...but only a few times. In larger doses, the\n         mushroom causes visions, nightmares.\n  Cerys: Yes, the last thing Udalryk needed more of. Thanks for your help.\u003c/pre\u003e\u003cpre\u003e  Geralt: Mardroeme related in any way to berserkers?\n  Hjort: Aye... But only in the tales told to children as they\u0027re put to sleep\n         on cold winter nights. Warriors who ate mardroeme were said to\n         transform into beasts when consumed by battle rage. But as I said,\n         it\u0027s only...\n  Geralt: Only a legend, I know.

You know your fungi.\n  Hjort: I do. Especially those which affect the mind, soothe it, summon waking\n         dreams. Udalryk suffered for years. I tried to help him in various\n         ways. Initially with prayer, then with poppy milk.\n  Cerys: But he\u0027s done with that now, right?\n  Hjort: It\u0027s not that simple... But we\u0027ll wean him off it yet.\n\nCerys: Blood and mardroeme. The taste of human flesh and a substance that\n       triggers visions. That well could\u0027ve caused the rage, maybe even the\n       transformation.\nGeralt: Maybe. Hard to believe someone spiked the mead here in the hall,\n        though, in front of all those witnesses.\nCerys: You\u0027re right. I helped prepare for the feast...I\u0027d \u0027ave noticed. It\n       might\u0027ve happened before they brought the drink upstairs. In the\n       cellars, maybe? C\u0027mon. We could find some clues there.\u003c/pre\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"},"parts":[]}]}]}]}}
