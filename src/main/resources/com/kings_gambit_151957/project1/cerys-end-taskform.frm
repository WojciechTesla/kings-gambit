Time to gather the\n         jarls.\u003c/pre\u003e\u003cpre\u003e  Geralt: What was her motive?\n  Cerys: It\u0027s obvious. She schemed this up to get rid of the other claimants,\n         slander our clan in the process. If she\u0027d succeeded, Svanrige would\u0027ve\n         been left the only claimant to Skellige\u0027s throne.\u003c/pre\u003e\u003cpre\u003e[Later, Geralt and Cerys visit the council of jarls.]\n\nDonar: I\u0027ve assembled the jarls in council as you demanded, Cerys an Craite.\n       You claim to know who\u0027s behind the slaughter at Kaer Trolde. Speak,\n       then! The blood of Skellige\u0027s sons and daughters -- whose hands does it\n       stain?\nCerys: Birna Bran\u0027s.\nBirna: The lass is mad. Do you think anyone will believe you?\nCerys: You had them serve poisoned mead to the berserkers.\nBirna: I beg your pardon! The servants at Kaer Trolde are not mine to command!\n       \u0027Twas your father who called for the feast, who assembled the guests!\nHolger: There\u0027s reason in these words...\u003c/pre\u003e\u003cpre\u003e • Donar: Have you any proof to confirm your accusation?\n   Cerys: I\u0027ve better. I\u0027ve a witness. Arnvald!\n   Arnvald: Cerys speaks true. Birna commanded me to poison the mead. When\n            Cerys and the witcher descended into the cellars--\n   Crach: You betrayed us? The clan that took you in?!\n   Birna: Good men! He\u0027s a servant to an Craite, a lackey! He will say what\n          they command him to say! He would lie for them even if he were to pay\n          for it with his head!\n   Lugos: Birna speaks true. Arnvald has served at Kaer Trolde ever since I\n          remember. Loyally, like a dog.\n\n • Cerys: Twas¹ my father\u0027s cupbearer Arnvald who helped him. Birna bribed\n          Arnvald. He tried to kill me and the witcher.\n   Crach: What?! Arnvald?!\n   Lugos: Aww, shite. Arnvald is Crach\u0027s loyal dog.\n   Birna: I thank you, Lugos... But so be it -- let us hear what slander\n          you\u0027ve commanded him to repeat. Bring him in.\n   Cerys: He\u0027s dead. And I wager it was you who silenced him.\n   Birna: I am not surprised to see you lie, Cerys... After all, like father,\n          like daughter. But your lie is clumsy, and that does surprise me.\n   Donar: Silence, Birna! And you, Cerys... How do you aim to prove your\n          accusation?\n\u003c/pre\u003e\u003cpre\u003e  Geralt: Got one more piece of evidence.\n\n  • Geralt: Arnvald fled Kaer Trolde, rode to an agreed meeting point. The\n            warriors who awaited him there tried to kill him.\n    Holger: What\u0027s that to do with Birna?\n    Arnvald: Those men wore Clan Tuirseach colors.\n    Birna: This is no proof. It is inconclusive. Anyone might have donned our\n           tartans.\n\n  • Cerys: A letter from Birna to Arnvald -- instructing him on how to spike\n           the mead.\n    Birna: It lacks my signature. It lacks my seal.\n    Cerys: But the hand is that of a woman, and you--\n    Birna: Hahahaha! Is this your proof, lass? Is this what you call evidence\n           of my supposed treason? Don\u0027t make me laugh.\n\n  Donar: Birna\u0027s right, Cerys. \u0027Tis all precious little proof of her\n         wrongdoin\u0027. Alas, your brother Hjalmar also has not presented anythin\u0027\n         that could clear your family\u0027s name...

Did Cerys entice you to cooperate?\n         I can imagine how. Or has Crach paid you to smear my name?\n  Crach: What did you say?!\n  Donar: Calm yourselves!\n  Udalryk: After what I saw on Spikeroog, I trust the witcher. More than I do\n           you.\n  Birna: You\u0027ve that right. But it\u0027s no proof of my guilt.\n\nDonar: Holger! Lugos! It\u0027s time we quit this damn castle.

You\n          gave Cerys no credence. Gave the witcher no credence. But you must\n          give credence to a son who accuses his own mother. The massacre was\n          her doing.

As the eldest of the jarls I cleanse the name of\n       Clan an Craite...and you, Birna Bran, I sentence to death.
